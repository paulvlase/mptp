{\bf
BitTorrent is the protocol responsible with the greatest chunk of traffic in the Internet. A new approach, similar to 
BitTorrent, is swift â€“ the multiparty(swarming) transport protocol. Swift may be understood as BitTorrent at the
transport layer. Ultimately swift aims at the abstraction of the Internet as a single big data cloud. This paper
proposes an approach to the swift integration into kernel as a transport protocol in the Linux kernel networking
stack.
