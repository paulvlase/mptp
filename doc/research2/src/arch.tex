In this section we present our current architectural design along with the motivation of choices. We are also going to 
detail our protocol and the packet structure used.

In figure \labelindexref{Figure}{img:archov} we see the main conceptual modules: Application module, 
wrapper library, peer discovery overlay and the swift transport protocol layer.

The Application module represents the remaining part of the old swift implementation. This is the part that remains in
user space and contains the file management and hash management features. 

The wrapper library module defines a socket-like API for the user space applications. An regular program will use those
calls instead of the normal socket ones to use the multiparty sockets. For the moment those calls are simulated system
calls that initially are resolved with the socket raw implementation (still in user space) . 
In the future this wrapper library will represent entry points into the kernel.

The peer discovery overlay will remain unchanged. It is still going to work based on UDP sockets and link the same
levels in the swift implementation as before. The peer discover will be part of the application implementation and it
will be at the developer choice how to implement and how to manage it. 

The multiparty protocol is implemented for now at user space level by a raw socket layer to validate our architecture.
This has the advantage of simulating the real design modularization but also permit an easier debugging and testing
procedure of the integration. In the next step this part will be represented by a kernel patch that will communicate
through custom made system calls with the wrapper library. This two phases are described in
\labelindexref{Figure}{img:kernel}

Raw socket implementation will support all syscalls and it will be a copy of our kernel implementation. 
This implementation will have the same API and behavior as the kernel implementation. Still, in the first
implementation, a swift socket will be available to act as only a seeder or a leecher, explicitly one operation transmit
data or receive data will be supported.
 
In the last implementation the swift protocol will be develop in kernel space, and it will be accessible with a
datagram socket that will support all socket syscalls. It will intend to support both operations (receive / send) data
over only one socket.
